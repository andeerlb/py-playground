## Create a virtual environment
A best practice among Python developers is to use a project-specific virtual environment. Once you activate that environment, any packages you then install are isolated from other environments, including the global interpreter environment, reducing many complications that can arise from conflicting package versions. You can create non-global environments in VS Code using Venv or Anaconda with Python: Create Environment.  

Open the Command Palette `(Ctrl+Shift+P)`, start typing the Python: Create Environment command to search, and then select the command.

Ensure your new environment is selected by using the Python: Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette.
